# [Covid19 Analytics Report In Nigeria](https://kareemat7.github.io/COVID-19/)

During my internship program at Blacktech,I was given a task to extract covid19 open source Data from [NCDC](http://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng) web. I imported the data into PowerBi to create a dashboard. It is a life data and will keep updating when i refresh it on PowerBi to give a recent covid19 records in Nigeria. The main goals of the project is to gain insight on how different states are affected and also to know the number of confirmed cases, number of cases on admission, number of discharged patients and number of death in each states. 

## **TOOL**
I used PowerBi for data vizualization.

## **DASHBOARD**
